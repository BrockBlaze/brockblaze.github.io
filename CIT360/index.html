    <h2>Java Collections</h2>
    <p>
      This week in CIT 360 I learned about collections like ArrayList, Queues,
      HashSet, and TreeMap
    </p>
    <p>
      Java Collection means a single unit of objects. Java Collection framework
      provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList,
      Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

    <h2>Exception Handling and Data Validation</h2>
    <p>
      This week I enter numbers into my program and divide them and then
      validated my numbers to make sure they were in fact numbers and I also did
      a catch an Arithmetic Exception to if you tried to divide by zero.
    </p>

    <h1 id="w4">WEEK 4</h1>
    <h2>JSON and HTTP</h2>
    <p>
      This week I used an HTTP request to get a txt file from the internet and
      then convert that into a JSON file which then I used Jackson JSON parser
      to convert that json into a java object.
    </p>

    <h2>JUnit</h2>
    <p>
      This week I used Junit to run test on a method that added two numbers
      together, I used assertEquals, and assertNotSame and other functions to
      test the methods outputs.
    </p>

    <h2>Use Case Document</h2>
    <p>
      This week I made an Use Case Document for a save system for a text base
      game.
    </p>

    <h1 id="w7">WEEK 7</h1>
    <h2>Servlet</h2>
    <p>
      This week I used servlets to make web applications for logging in and also
      a servlet to square a number a user entered in.
    </p>

    <h1 id="w8">WEEK 8</h1>
    <h2>Threads, Runnables, Executors</h2>
    <p>
      This week I executed runnables that I set up, to run on different threads
      at the same time.
    </p>

    <h1 id="w9">WEEK 9</h1>
    <h2>Hibernate</h2>
    <p>
      This week I used the hibernate packages to connect to a MySQL database to
      pull data from.
    </p>

    <h1 id="w10">WEEK 10</h1>
    <h2>UML</h2>
    <p>
      This week I made multiple diagrams to help me understand systems that I
      would have in my final project.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Project Proposal</h2>
    <p>
      This week I wrote a proposal for my final Project which will be a Text
      based game that used servels, hibernate, Exception Handling and Data
      Validation, and Threads, Runnables, Executors.<br /><br />

      The Application will work through a browser to have the user play a
      text-base game that will have progression and randomization. This game
      will also save player data to a database. The player will also load those
      save game states from the database.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Exception Handling and Data Validation – verifying inputs and handling
        exception cause by those inputs
      </li>
      <li>Hibernate – for loading and saving the player data</li>
      <li>Servlets – A website for the player to play the game in.</li>
      <li>Threads, Runnables, and Executors – a gameplay mechanic</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Project</h2>
    <p>
      This week I work a lot on my final Project and was able to set up a lot of the base functions for my web app game. This is a screenshot of what the player will see when they click play game.
    </p>

    <h1 id="w13">WEEK 13</h1>
    <h2>Final Project Continued</h2>
    <p>
      This week I finished up my project and Use Case Document. I was able to
      Create and Delete Players from my Database using methods like
      session.update(Ojbect) and session.delete(Object) this mehtod for
      hibernate I found on the internet seem to work a lot better then trying to
      right mysql statements.
