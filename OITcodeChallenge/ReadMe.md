Run this game simply by opening the webpage. 

I look into the applications suggested, both vue.js and nuxt and both seemed cool but after doing some research and setup I decided it would take too long to setup to use for this simple game. I know you want to see me use technologies I haven't used before, but in the end I thought making the program with what I do know would be more fun and satifying for all.

I still don't work with api every day but I hope this shows you that I can learn new things quickly.

the challenges I ran into in this project were shuffling the word and converting the json to a string.

I looked up different methods of how to shuffle a string and then build my own function to shuffle the word.

I had trouble with converting the json to a string because I didn't know the difference between square brackets and curly brackets 

square brackets are arrays inside a json object

and curly brakets contant the entire json object. 

After learning this I was able to convert it into a string.
